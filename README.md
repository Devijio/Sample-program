## Project Overview

DIMS encompasses a variety of components organized into distinct categories, each serving a specific purpose. Here's a breakdown of the project's key components:

## Initial Setup

The `initial/setup.sh` script is responsible for setting up the project environment and necessary components. It performs the following tasks:

- Creates directories for volumes to be mounted.
- Installs the `docker-compose.yaml` configuration.
- Starts the Docker database server.
- Collects the admin email address.
- Launches Docker containers for the DIMS server (UI + Backend) and nginx.
- Creates a local database user named 'admin' with an encoded password.
- Sends an email to the admin containing the password.
- Generates academic calendar data with working days.
- Sets up a crontab entry to execute `scheduler.py` every minute.

## Scheduler

The `scheduler/scheduler.py` script is the core of the scheduling system. It relies on common methods provided in `common/common.py`.

## MDM (Mobile Device Management)

The MDM section covers various providers:

- Jamf: `mdm/jamf.py`
- Meraki: `mdm/meraki.py`
- Google: `mdm/google.py`
- Intune: `mdm/intune.py`

## Inventory

The inventory management module consists of:

- TipWeb: `inventory/tipweb.py`
  1. Retrieves data from JAMF.
  2. Writes data to MDM table.
- IncidentIQ: `inventory/incidentiq.py`
  1. Retrieves data from JAMF.
  2. Writes data to MDM table.

## Network

The network management section includes:

- Meraki: `network/meraki.py`
  1. Retrieves data from JAMF.
  2. Writes data to MDM table.
- WLC (Wireless LAN Controller): `network/wlc.py`
  1. Retrieves data from JAMF.
  2. Writes data to MDM table.

## Loading Daily Data

This module handles the daily data loading process:

- `load/load.py`: Generates content in the result_table.
- `load/transfer.py`: Generates comments for device transfers.
- `load/settings_labels.py`: Populates labels.

## Validations

Validation modules ensure data accuracy:

- `validation/lisd/daily_usage.py`:
  - Monitors daily usage file reception through a cron job.
  - Notifies the DevOps team via email if issues arise.
- `validation/data_validation.py`:
  - Performs data validation in `results_table` and other tables.
  - Alerts the DevOps team via email for any discrepancies.

## Alerts

The Alerts component:

- Acts as a service to receive alerts from DIMS applications at customer locations.
- Is deployed as a Kubernetes application.
- Presents output at https://logs.swensa.net.
- Triggers SMS alerts for critical issues to the DevOps team.

## Reports

- Monthly reports are generated by: `Reports/monthly.py`

## Common

The Common module, `common/common.py`:

- Reads the `jsondata` column for the given `jobinfoid`.
- Updates `jobinfo` table rows with accurate `lastupdate` and `errormsg`.
- Sends alerts to the monitoring service on AWS Kubernetes.
- Sends email notifications to the DevOps team.
